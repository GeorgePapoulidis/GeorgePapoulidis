I am a Computer Science student at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.
I am trying to kickstart my carreer as a software developer and one day be able to work as a game developer.
I like low level programming, like Assembly, C and even C++, even though I don't currently have enough experience.
I am looking forward to any opportunity that is offered to me.
You can email me at geopapougr@gmail.com and ask me anything.
In person, even though I am short and appear small, don't underestimate me :P
